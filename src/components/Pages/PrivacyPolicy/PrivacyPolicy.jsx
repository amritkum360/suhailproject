        Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our website. This policy does
        not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals
        that we do not employ or manage. Information you choose to disclose publicly on the
        website (i.e., information that is viewable to other Website users) will not be considered
        Personal Information.
      </p>

         <p className="text-muted">We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Website, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (as set forth in this Section and in Section III below). We collect the following types of information.

            </p>
            <h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Information You Provide To Us:</h4>
            <p className="text-muted">We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, during registration for evaluation or in our system, we collect Personal Information such as your name, user name, email address, IP address, browser information, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third-party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you are consenting to have the information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information is covered by this Privacy Policy. We may collect other Personal Information you provide us through your use of our services, such as notes you compose about your contacts; however, these private notes will not be shared with other Website users, unless you choose to share them. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
            </p>
            <h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Information Collected Automatically:            </h4>
            <p className="text-muted">Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted">Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website’s best features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted">When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often customers use parts of the Website so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
</p>

<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Data Accessibility</h4>
<p className="text-muted">Through our student portal, each student has access to a personal profile to access, review, and correct any personal information at any time.
</p>

<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Data Retention</h4>
<p className="text-muted">When students cancel their accounts, we will retain their personal information for 12 months after which all the information will be deleted from our system and it will not be possible to retrieve progress records.
</p>

<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">E-Mail And Other Communications</h4>
<p className="text-muted">We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses or communicate with you about your use of the Website. The material is generic and informational in nature and does not rely on any behavioral or personal information (such as how well a student is performing in a curriculum) to provide targeted advertising to students.
</p>
<p className="text-muted">If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference through your account settings. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service.
</p>

<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Will Eilaf Share Any Of My Information It Receives?</h4>    
<p className="text-muted">We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone.
</p>
<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Affiliated Businesses And Third-Party Websites We Do Not Control</h4>
<p className="text-muted">In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). We may, for example, sell products or provide services jointly with affiliated businesses, or work with third-party websites to enhance your online experience. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to choose to automatically transmit information you input on the Website to your profile on a third party website; for example, you may update your contact information on the Website and allow that update to also be reflected in your Facebook account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to allow the automatic transmissions discussed above, please review all third-party websites’ policies before engaging in such automatic transmissions on the Website. In addition, we will only contract with future companies that adhere to the same Pledge principles that members do.
</p>
<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Agents</h4>
<p className="text-muted">We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. All third-party partners must fully comply with our privacy policy and the Student Privacy Pledge and remain consistent with the same Pledge principles that Pledge members adhere to, including security and data retention principles. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For example, if you were to engage in a credit card transaction via the Website, we would need to allow a credit card processing company to verify the transaction; however, that company would only be authorized to use your credit card information to the extent we needed their assistance in completing your transaction.
</p>

<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Business Transfers</h4>
<p className="text-muted">We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we are reorganized or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. We will give you advance notice if your Personal Information will be transferred to a third party in this manner so that you can delete your account with us if you choose.
</p>
<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Protection Of Company And Others</h4>
<p className="text-muted">We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">With Your Consent</h4>

<p className="text-muted">Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
</p>
<p className="text-muted">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records. All our services are hosted and integrated with Google cloud infrastructure which complies with the highest standards of information security such as SSL, data encryption, but we cannot guarantee complete security.

<h4 className="fw-bold mt-4">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h4>

<p className="text-muted">We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website and sending you an email. If you disagree with the new policy, you can email us at info@eilaf.academy, and then a representative will typically contact you to discuss the new policy if you reject it, you can request to delete your account and all personal information will be deleted.
